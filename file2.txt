the world is full of lies. find your perfect lie to make a successful life.
everyone has a story, the way and manner in which it is presented will motivate others, produce hate from others, different perception frm different people.
this is not because the person is peerfect, but the person who sits down planning his or her life, made it regardless. 
never fear the power of regret for it defines you.
